# C++ code for RabbitMQ tutorials

Here you can find the C++ code examples from [RabbitMQ
tutorials](https://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html).

To successfully use the examples you will need a RabbitMQ node running locally.

## Requirements
Examples use [rabbitmq-c library](https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c)	that must be installed first.
You can build the examples via CMakeFile.txt.
Examples are tested on CentOS 7, RabbitMQ 3.10.0, Erlang 23.3.1 and built with Visual Studio Code 1.73.1
